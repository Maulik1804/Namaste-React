1. What is Emmet?
-> Emmet is a plugin/tools for text editors(like vsCode,Sublime etc) that allow you to write short abbreviations(short form) and expand them into full HTML & CSS code.
   ex: div.container>ul>li 

2. Difference between a Library and Framework? 
-> - Library: Collection of pre-written code you can call when needed.
              You are in control of the flow (you decide when and where to use the library).
              Example: React, jQuery, Lodash

  - Framework : Provides a skeleton / structure for your project.
                Framework controls the flow; you fill in the missing parts.
                Example: Angular, Django, Spring, vue, express, next

3. What is CDN? Why do we use it?
-> CDN (Content Delivery Network) = A group of distributed servers placed worldwide to deliver static assets (CSS, JS, images, fonts) faster to users.
   - Why use it?
     Faster loading (delivers from nearest server).
     Reduces server load.
     Increases availability (backup servers).
     Browser caching works better with common CDNs.

4. Why is React known as React?
-> React was named “React” because it reacts to changes in data.
   It uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update and re-render components only where changes happen → creating a reactive user interface.

5. What is crossorigin in <script> tag?
-> The crossorigin attribute specifies how browsers handle cross-origin requests for scripts.
   Values: anonymous → No user credentials(authentication information) (cookies, HTTP auth).
           use-credentials → Sends credentials like cookies.
           Often used with CDN + Subresource Integrity (SRI) (integrity attribute) to check file authenticity.
   Example:  <script src="https://cdn.com/react.js"
                crossorigin="anonymous"
                integrity="sha384-xyz">
             </script>

6. Difference between React and ReactDOM
-> React → Core library for building UI components (defines how components work, state, lifecycle).
   ReactDOM → Specifically deals with the DOM (Document Object Model).
              Without ReactDOM, React itself doesn’t know how to render to the browser DOM (it could be native, mobile, etc.).

7. Difference between react.development.js and react.production.js (via CDN)
-> 1.react.development.js : Larger in size
                            Includes warnings, error messages, extra checks → easier for debugging.
                            Used in local development.
   2.react.production.js :  Smaller, minified, optimized for speed.
                            No extra warnings.
                            Used when deploying to live websites.

8. ● What is async and defer in <script>?
-> Both are used to load external JavaScript files without blocking HTML parsing:
   1.async - Script is downloaded in parallel with HTML parsing.
             Executes immediately after download finishes (may interrupt HTML parsing).
             Best for independent scripts (analytics, ads).

   2.defer - Script is downloaded in parallel, but execution is deferred until after HTML parsing is complete.
             Preserves script order.
             Best for main JS logic.
             Example: <script src="file.js" async></script>
                      <script src="file.js" defer></script>
